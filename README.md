Dynamic Web Applications with JavaScript - Project 2 Pokédex app made by Terhi Petäjäjärvi and Tiia Kiviluoma.

The idea was to create a Pokédex app that uses API library to find information about Pokémons. Users are able to find and identify Pokémons by searching with a name / part of a name.The search results also show the type of the Pokémon. The design is made to attract Pokémon (Go) players as us two. 

We used a couple of Youtube videos and ChatGpt to help. The design is fully made by us. We didn't use external libraries or hard coded onclick-listeners. We both feel like we understood the assignement and understand what the code does, so we believe we deserve full 35 points.
